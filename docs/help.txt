Requirements:
	- Github account
	- Git

If this is your first time using Git, follow the instructions below

I. VirtualBox Installations

It is easier if you know how to work in a Linux environment. If you wish to
work on a Linux environment but doesnt want to completely use Linux for everyday
use, please install VirtualBox or any other software that lets you run Linux
alongside your current OS.

For Mac users: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Mac%20OS%20X%20build%20instructions
For Windows users: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

You can use any Distro you want: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Linux Mint,
Manjaro Linux, Gentoo, etc.

II. Git Installation

Depends on what kind of environment you work on. I am not going to create an 
installation guide for Git because there are lots of reliable websites for that.
Here is one:

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git 

To summarize what Git is, it is used to connect to github, where the project is.

III. Contribute to the project

Set username and email for Git:

	git config --global user.name [username]
	git config --global user.email [email]

You need to clone the project to be able to work on it locally:

	git clone https://github.com/nickj10/NJ_Domino.git
	
After cloning:
ALWAYS create your own branch and do not merge directly to main branch.

	git branch [branch_name]

To go to your branch:
	
	git checkout [branch_name]

	git push --set-upstream origin [branch_name]

If there are files in the project that are not on your local directory,
it will not allow you to push. First, you have to pull the files and then
push & commit:

	git pull

It is BETTER to merge MASTER branch to your branch first to see if it is
compatible to what we already have in the master branch.

	git checkout [branch_name]
	git merge --no-ff master

When you want to commit (add files to the project through your branch first),
you add the following commands.
NOTE: Do not push if you are "detached from HEAD"

	git add -A
	git commit -am "add_commit_message"
	git push

And now if everything is okay, merge to master branch:

	git checkout master
	git merge --no-ff [branch_name]
